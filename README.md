This project is for the Data Incubator. The project is focused on the FDA adverse effect reporting system (FAERS). 
https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html
FAERS database contains over 11 million clinical reports where the drugs, indications, and adverse effects were recorded. As a post-markteing drug safety data source, FAERS can be used to perform various statistical analysis, which may reveal some unexpected effects. This project will produce a set of query and analyzing tools for FAERS.
